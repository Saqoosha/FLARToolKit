/**
* The FreeCamera3D class creates a camera that views the area in the direction the camera is aimed.
* <p/>
* A camera defines the view from which a scene will be rendered. Different camera settings would present a scene from different points of view.
* <p/>
* 3D cameras simulate still-image, motion picture, or video cameras of the real world. When rendering, the scene is drawn as if you were looking through the camera lens.

	* The FreeCamera3D constructor lets you create a camera that views the area in the direction the camera is aimed.
	*
	* Its initial position can be specified in the initObject.
	*
	* @param	zoom		This value specifies the scale at which the 3D objects are rendered. Higher values magnify the scene, compressing distance. Use it in conjunction with focus.
	* <p/>
	* @param	focus		This value is a positive number representing the distance of the observer from the front clipping plane, which is the closest any object can be to the camera. Use it in conjunction with zoom.
	* <p/>
	* @param	initObject	An optional object that contains user defined properties with which to populate the newly created DisplayObject3D.
	* <p/>
	* It includes x, y, z, rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ, scaleX, scaleY scaleZ and a user defined extra object.
	* <p/>
	* If extra is not an object, it is ignored. All properties of the extra field are copied into the new instance. The properties specified with extra are publicly available.
	* <p/>
	* The following initObject property is also recognized by the constructor:
	* <ul>
	* <li><b>sort</b>: A Boolean value that determines whether the 3D objects are z-depth sorted between themselves when rendering. The default value is true.</li>
	* </ul>
